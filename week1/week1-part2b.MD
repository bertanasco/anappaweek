such fun!

unfortunately reality is boring and we are constrained by physics, and uhmm this is the part where I get to tell you the relation of these bollywod gifs to structures and eventually how this is related to an android project. 


Let's use  **Project view** to check the files and folder.

###.gradle folder###

this is just [gradle's](https://gradle.org/) cache information. It get's created every time you create/build a project.


###.idea folder###

Contain's your project settings.
Copy paste from jetbrain's wiki:

	The .idea directory contains a set of configuration files (.xml). 
	Each file contains only a portion of configuration data pertaining to a certain functional area which is reflected in the name of a file, for example, compiler.xml, encodings.xml, modules.xml.

#What We Will Do#
 As promised in [part 1](http://bertanasco.com/post/121348406470/week-1-mandatory-hello-world-part-1) , we would go over the following topics
 
  1.  Navigating Android Studio
  2.  Discuss the contents of a project
  3.  Add the Doge image in the App

Here's a an xkcd webcomic for no apparent reason.

awwww 

ha! Now let's start.

 
#Navigating Android Studio#

Don't get discouraged if opening **Android Studio** reminds you of  Atlantis' cockpit . Practice and I'm confident that you could easily settle in.

<sup>My initial reactions when using the IDE. that or because I'm a noob **cries in the corner** <sup>

I'm a firm believer of the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) and IMHO we could also apply it here. I think we only require 20% of the IDE's features in order to be productive. Beside the obvious main editing screen, I think that as long as you could navigate the files and run the application and tests you're good to go (You could always explore the other features like debuging the app etc later). I shall discuss the basic **Android Studio** features base on this premise.

#1. Navigate the files#
  
## 1.a via Project Explorer ##
  **Shortcut** 
 
  **Cmd + 1** , show\hide the project explorer

  **What it's for** 
  
  This is pretty much similar to the project explorer in Eclipse. it shows the structure of the files in your project.
   
  A drop down is available for you to switch to the different   
  **Android Studio Views**, I shall discuss some of the important   
  views in the next section

###Android View###
    
  ![](http://i.imgur.com/svIsCcB.png) 
    
Displays the key files in your project ( which in theory, is meant to simplify the development) , a flattened version of the files. IMHO, it would be better to use the **Project view** if you are  just starting out
    
###Project View###
    
Ahh the classic **Project View**, it basically shows a segregated  view of the files.It displays the structure of the files the same way they are stored in your system. Useful when you are just figuring out how things are connected.

###Tests View###

Basically list all your test classes! I think I shall write a separate blog entry about testing.

I'll show how to run the test later.

###Other views###
You could also check out these links for futher information about the views : 
 [Android developer site](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html)
 [ IntelliJ project organization](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Project+Organization)
  
###1.b Other forms of navigation###
 **Cmd + O**  and **Cmd + Shift + O**  key combinations are similar to Eclipse's **Cntrl + Shift + R** . It would show a pop-up window where you could type in the name of the file/class that you wish to open.

#2. Running the application and tests #

##Running the app (emulator)##

We showed this in part one. You could run the application by **^ R** key combination or by clicking the **Run App** ![](http://i.imgur.com/pNfRUoR.png) button in the toolbar 

![](http://i.imgur.com/nu6a05V.png)
<sup>The green button is there somewhere <sup>

You will then be asked which device you would run the app

###Running tests###
Below are different options on how to run a test ( all of these are similar to how you do it in **Eclipse**) 

1. In the project explorer, you  could run the test by right clicking    on a test class and selecting **Run** in the context menu  
   ![](http://i.imgur.com/ENXhY46.png) 
  
  that or you could use  **Cntrl + Shift + R** key combination

2. Once the file is open, Right clicking the file in the main editing area and selecting **Run** would also execute the test . Again you could also use  **Cntrl + Shift + R** key combination

3. In the **Run window** (Bottom part of the IDE) you could click ![](http://i.imgur.com/pNfRUoR.png) to rerun the test , or **Cmd + R**

Well that's about it for navigating Android Studio. I barely discussed 20% of the features LOL. Well atleast I tried :D Up to you to explore the other parts of the IDE

uhmmm I still have 2 topics to discuss but I'm afraid I need to do write them in a separate entry...

uhmm sorry :(
